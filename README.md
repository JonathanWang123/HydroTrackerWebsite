# HydroTracker Website
This project was for my Honors Intro to Engineering class at Rutgers. The goal of the assignment was to develop any human centered design product with the main purpose
being something to help people with everyday tasks. My group decided to create a waterbottle that tracks its users consumption and log it in a similar fashion to the
health app on an iPhone or a fitbit. This Website is the website we used to log our work such as documents, roadmaps, pictures, etc.
